Natural Selection 2
===================
:category: Gaming

If you enjoy RTS or FPS this is a great game, if you enjoy both it's the
greatest game. I really enjoy playing an alien commander and building upgrades
and bases tossing out cysts everywhere, or playing the extremely team oriented
marines and helping clear out a hallway of skulks. Lots of fun no matter how you
play it.

Only warning I have is that there is a steep learning curve, don't play
commander for a while and do play the tutorial, you really need to learn how to
play it or your team will hate you.

I highly recommend checking it out immediately, `it's on steam`_!
