Pinry 1.3, new design and RSS feeds.
====================================
:category: Releases

I don't often post about releases of stuff I've already released but this
release is really cool because it's a complete design overhual. Pinry now looks
fresh as ever and is completely responsive. On top of that we now have some
`documentation`_ and a fresh website and demo at `getpinry.com`_.
