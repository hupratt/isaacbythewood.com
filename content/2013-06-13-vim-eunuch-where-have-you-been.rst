vim-eunuch, where have you been?!?!
===================================
:category: Coding

I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've typed
``vim /etc/some/config/file``, completed a few changes, hit ``:w`` and then yell
in frustration as I forgot to append ``sudo`` to my vim command. Thank you for
saving me from that `vim-eunuch`_, all I have to do now is type ``:SudoWrite`` and
it will allow me to type in my password and save anyways.
