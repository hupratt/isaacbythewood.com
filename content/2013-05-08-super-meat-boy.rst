Super Meat Boy
==============
:category: Gaming


I should have played this game when it was released. It's incredible, I love how
fast everything is and collecting bandages to unlock all the characters. I also
can't go without mentioning the soundtrack. It was made by Danny B and fits the
game amazingly well. If you like a fast paced platformer this is for you.

My only complaint are that the leaderboards are full of people who cheated with
a time of 0.00, if you have friends who play this game you can look at your
friends leaderboard times but don't bother comparing yourself globally to the
cheaters.

I highly recommend checking it out immediately, `it's on steam`_!
