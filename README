# django-isaac

My personal website hosted on a Rackspace Cloud Server. Has switched between
Linode, Heroku, back to Linode, back to Heroku and now to Rackspace Cloud
Servers. Quite the journey for a personal website to have. My reasoning? I like
trying out new systems.

Much like the hosting, the code in general has undergone many rewrites and
changes, the only thing that has stayed the same throughout is the look of the
website. I'm fairly happy with it.

Feel free to use this code however you want, it's licensed under the Simplified
BSD License. Basically just don't blame me if this code breaks something.
