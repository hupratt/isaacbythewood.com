Payday 2
========
:category: Gaming


One of the funnest first person shooters I've ever played.*

\* As long as you have 3 dedicated friends to play it with you. This game gets
very monotonous very fast if you don't have a group of friends to play with. The
AI is terrible and it's hard to finish most of the funner missions with them.

That being said I did have 3 dedicated friends to play this game with and it was
great. We've already had hours of fun and will have more in the future. The
developers seem to update the game often and, while it still feels a bit buggy
and beta-ish, I feel like they are updating the game and fixing stuff at a
reasonable rate. I plan on continuing to play this game for many more months.

I highly recommend checking it out, `it's on steam`_!
