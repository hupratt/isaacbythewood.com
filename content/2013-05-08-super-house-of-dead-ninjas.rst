Super House of Dead Ninjas
==========================
:category: Gaming

An incredible fast paced platformer. You have to fight your way down to the
bottom of a tower killing monsters, collecting items, and getting upgrades. The
tower is randomly generated and you get new items everytime. I enjoyed playing
this game for quite a few hours and could easily get in the groove and zone out.
A perfect game after a long day's work for me.

While I can't highly recommend this game I still think it's a fun time waster
and worth a few playthroughs, `it's on steam`_.
