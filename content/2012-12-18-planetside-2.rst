PlanetSide 2
============
:category: Gaming

An insanely fun FPS that does the free to play model very well. I've personally
spent about 120 bucks on this game but have quite a few friends keeping up with
me who have spent absolutely nothing.

Basically think of the game as BF3 but on a massive scale. Some of the mechanics
aren't as clean as BF3 but the sheer size of the fights you find yourself in
makes it insanely enjoyable none-the-less.

I highly recommend checking it out immediately, `it's on steam`_!
