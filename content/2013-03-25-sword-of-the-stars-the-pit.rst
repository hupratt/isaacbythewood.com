Sword of the Stars: The Pit
===========================
:category: Gaming

A game that you need to stick with to actually enjoy. There is no tutorial and
it is very hard. You will die. I recommend gathering some recipes in easy mode
before progressing to harder difficulties. Since The Pit is perma-death you can
get to the 30th floor and die with the end at the edge of your monitor and you
will cry because it might take you 20 hours to get there.

If you do happen to beat it though it is a very rewarding experience simply
because of how hard it is. You feel very accomplished.

While I can't highly recommend this game I still think it's fun and worth
beating, `it's on steam`_.
