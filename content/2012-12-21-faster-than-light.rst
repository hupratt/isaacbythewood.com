Faster Than Light

:category: Gaming

As a huge SciFi and space exploration fanatic I am unsure why I haven't picked
this game up before. It's a great example of a simple, straightforward indie
game that encompasses days of fun.

The overall play is basic, you have a ship, you improve your ship with upgrades
and manage it's systems along with it's crew repair your ship while fighting off
other ships. Your goal is to get to your home words/base and defend it from the
"Rebels". Along the way you have a bunch of mini-quests and save a bunch of
people of which all are optional.

As you beat the game you unlock more ships to start with which have different
abilities and different playstyles. Each playthrough is semi-randomized giving
you a unique experience every time. Overall this game goes down as one of the
best I've ever played, definitely the best indie-game I've ever played.

I highly recommend checking it out, `it's on steam`_!
